# 🕹️ Tic-Tac-Toe (Tris) Web App: Full-Stack Edition

A professional, collaborative web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. Originally a front-end prototype, this project has evolved into a dynamic Full-Stack application using **PHP** and **SQL** to manage user authentication, persistent game states, and match history.
